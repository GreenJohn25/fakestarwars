        I thought this idea was really funny at one point. Pretty sure i was wrong,
        but the funniest thing to do with a bad idea is commit to it.
        So i kept making this. I like star wars, but they are kids movies
        that are about space wizards, and its really funny that nerds take it so seriously. 
        The Last Jedi is the best star wars movie, Rian Johnson rocks.
